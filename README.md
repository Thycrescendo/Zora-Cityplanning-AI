# ðŸŒ† Zora-Cityplanning+AI  

**Decentralized Participatory Urban Planning Powered by AI & Zora Coins** 

[![screenshot](./screenshot.png)](https://esri.github.io/participatory-planning)

The app uses various API features such as [3D drawing](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-widgets-Sketch.html), [glTF import](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/import-gltf/index.html) and [client-side filtering](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-layers-support-FeatureFilter.html). The example scene used in the app is located in Dumbo, Brooklyn NY.

On the technical side the app is built using [React](https://react.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [vite](https://vite.dev/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)


## ðŸš¨ Problem  
Urban planning is broken:  
- Decisions are made **top-down** with little community input.  
- Funding is **opaque** and slow.  
- Projects fail to reflect real-world needs (e.g., bike lanes that flood, parks nobody uses).  

Zora-Cityplanning+AI empowers citizens to **design, fund, and trade** the future of their cities.  

## âœ¨ Solution  
- **AI-Driven Proposals**: Predict project impact (traffic, environment, cost) using machine learning.  
- **Tokenized Governance**: Mint ERC-20 coins for proposals via Zoraâ€™s Coins Protocol.  
- **Onchain Democracy**: Stake tokens to vote, trade, and earn fees from implemented projects.
